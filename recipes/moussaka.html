    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Moussaka is a layered, baked Mediterranean and Balkan casserole dish most
      famously associated with Bulgaria, featuring layers of eggplant or
      potatoes, a rich spiced meat sauce, and a thick, creamy béchamel sauce on
      top. It's a hearty comfort food, often made with ground lamb or beef, and
      has regional variations across the Middle East and Balkans.
